Notation
    Name: Shlaer-Mellor
    About: Source of Executable UML / xUML modeling semantics
    Why use it: Designed for fast easy hand drawing. Great for whiteboards and notes!

    Name: Starr
    About: Inspired by Shlaer-Mellor but without the little c's to drag around on class diagrams
    Why use it: Stealth mode! Mimimal drawing clutter to put the focus on the subject. Easy to draw online

    Name: xUML
    About: AKA, Executable UML. Usage of UML to represent executable semantics
    Why use it: Standards conformance. You are showing diagram to someone who knows, uses or must use UML
